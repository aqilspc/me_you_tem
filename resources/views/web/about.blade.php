                            <p>Me You Them is focused on self love and building confidence within people who experience acne and other skin conditions. This website doesn’t focus on how to suppress your pimples, but how to support your skin. The goal is to have healthy skin not perfect skin, because perfection doesn't exist</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30%;">
                                Me You Them is here to educate everyone 
                                on the facts, causes and normality of skin conditions, as well as how to prevent, help 
                                or even embrace them.

                                The website aims to break away from the way 
                                the beauty industries and media approach skin conditions. We’re conditioned to believe in 
                                the “better” version of ourselves because we live in a society that eternally wants to sell us “solutions” so that we, too, can become perfect. However, we know that the perfect we’ve been sold is photoshopped. Therefore 
                                it’s essential to direct our energy towards self-love, positive, or even selfless acts.
